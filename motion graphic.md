## no pain.


<iframe width="750" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mw0KWKOjKrM" title="[FMV] Sillica Gel - NO PAIN (fan animated music video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The animation is inspired by the musical silica gel-no pain.


Silica Gel commented on 'NO PAIN' as 'a story of trans-construction'.
Many artists are frustrated and leave in front of the wall of reality. Sometimes, I looked at those who were leaving for reality and overlapped with me.
"Wouldn't that have been my appearance?"
Maybe in a parallel world, by telling stories about people who couldn't do music, art, or art, art 
I would like to ask the question of whether art and a life without pain are truly peaceful lives.

This video is an unofficial title sequence work for the movie "Regarding Kevin."
This video is a project aimed at depicting the inner emotions of the main characters, Kevin and Eva, from the movie using color, drawing, and motion graphics. In the beginning, we aim to represent Eva's confusing emotions, in the middle, Kevin's troubled emotions, and towards the end, the climax of events visually.
