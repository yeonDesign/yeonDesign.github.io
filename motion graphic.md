## silica gel-no pain.


<iframe width="750" height="465" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mw0KWKOjKrM" title="[FMV] Sillica Gel - NO PAIN (fan animated music video)" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" allowfullscreen></iframe>

The animation is based on the musical silica gel-no pain.

Silica Gel commented on 'NO PAIN' as 'a story of trans-construction'.
Maybe in a parallel world, by telling stories about people who couldn't do music, art, or art, art 
I would like to ask the question of whether art and a life without pain are truly peaceful lives.


해당 애니메이션은 음악 실리카겔-no pain 을 기반으로한 애니메이션이다.


실리카겔은 'NO PAIN'에 대해 ‘시공초월에 관한 이야기’ 라고 코멘트 하였다.
어쩌면 평행세계에선 음악을, 미술을, 예술을 하지 못했을 이들에 대한 스토리를 담아냄으로써 
예술과 고통없는 삶이 진정으로 평안한 삶인가에 대해 물음을 던지고자 한다.

This video is an unofficial title sequence work for the movie "Regarding Kevin."
This video is a project aimed at depicting the inner emotions of the main characters, Kevin and Eva, from the movie using color, drawing, and motion graphics. In the beginning, we aim to represent Eva's confusing emotions, in the middle, Kevin's troubled emotions, and towards the end, the climax of events visually.
